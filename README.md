## Speech samples

Examples of synthesized speech by "__Tacotron2-SS__" , "__Tacotron2-FR__" and "__Tacotron2-KD__" systems.



Speech samples are available at   [demo page](https://ttslr.github.io/ICASSP2020/).



__Tacotron2-FR__: Tacotron2-based model with free running (FR) mode


__Tacotron2-SS__: Tacotron2-based model with scheduled sampling (SS) mode


__Tacotron2-KD__: Tacotron2-based model with proposed teacher-student training method by using knowledge distillation (KD)
